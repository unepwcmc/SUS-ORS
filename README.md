# Rails 7 Nuxt Template

This project has a front and backend distinction that makes it differ from the
way that Rails projects are usually deployed.

It is built using Nuxt as the frontend framework (wrapped around Vue.js 2) and
Ruby on Rails (version 7) in API mode for the backend (with Ruby 3.1.0).
